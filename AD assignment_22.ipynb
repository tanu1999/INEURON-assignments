    "Q1. What are the benefits of the built-in array package, if any?\n",
    "Ans: Arrays represent multiple data items of the same type using a single name. In arrays, the elements can be accessed\n",
    "    randomly by using the index number. Arrays allocate memory in contiguous memory locations for all its elements.\n",
    "    Hence there is no chance of extra memory being allocated in case of arrays. This avoids memory overflow or shortage \n",
    "    of memory in arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What are some of the array package's limitations ?\n",
    "Ans: The number of elements to be stored in an array should be known in advance. An array is a static structure\n",
    "    (which means the array is of fixed size). Once declared the size of the array cannot be modified.\n",
    "    The memory which is allocated to it cannot be increased or decreased.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Insertion and deletion are quite difficult in an array as the elements are stored in consecutive memory locations and the \n",
    "    shifting operation is costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Allocating more memory than the requirement leads to wastage of memory space and less allocation of memory also leads to a \n",
    "    problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Describe the main differences between the array and numpy packages ?\n",
    "Ans: The array package doesn't provide any help with numerical calculation with the items insdie it in number form while NumPy \n",
    "    give you a wide variety of numerical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    An array is a single dimensional entity which hold the numerical data, while numpy can have more than 1 dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In case of array, item can be accessed by its index position and it is easy task while in numpy item is accessed by its column \n",
    "    and row index, which makes it slightly time taking. Same goes with appending operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In case of array we do not form a tabular structure, while in numpy it forms a tabular structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Explain the distinctions between the empty, ones, and zeros functions ?\n",
    "Ans: The distinctions between the empty, ones, and zero functions are as follows :\n",
    "\n",
    "Empty function: An empty function is a function that does not contain any statement within its body. If you try to write a\n",
    "                function definition without any statement in python ,it will return an error. To avoid this, we use pass \n",
    "                statement.pass is a special statement in Python that does nothing. It only works as a dummy statement.\n",
    "Ones: This function returns a new array of given shape and data type, where the element’s value is 1.\n",
    "Zeros: This function returns a new array of given shape and data type, where the element’s value is 0.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q5. In the fromfunction function, which is used to construct new arrays, what is the role of the callable argument ?\n",
    "Ans: Its function is to execute the function over each coordinate and the resulting array. The function is called with N \n",
    "    parameters, where N is the rank of shape. Each parameter represents the coordinates of the array varying along a specific \n",
    "    axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What happens when a numpy array is combined with a single-value operand (a scalar, such as an int or a floating-point value)\n",
    "    through addition, as in the expression A + n ?\n",
    "Ans: If any scaler value such as integer is added to the numpy array then all the elements inside the array will add that value\n",
    "    in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Can array-to-scalar operations use combined operation-assign operators (such as += or *=)? What is the outcome ?\n",
    "Ans: It will carry out provided operation on all elements of array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Does a numpy array contain fixed-length strings? What happens if you allocate a longer string to one of these arrays ?\n",
    "Ans: : Yes, it is possible that we can include a string of fixed length in numpy array. The dtype of any numpy array containing\n",
    "        string values is the maximum length of any string present in the array.Once set, it will only be able to store new\n",
    "        string having length not more than the maximum length at the time of the creation. If we try to reassign some another\n",
    "        string value having length greater than the maximum length of the existing elements, it simply discards all the values\n",
    "        beyond the maximum length accept upto those values which are under the limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. What happens when you combine two numpy arrays using an operation like addition (+) or multiplication (*)? What are the\n",
    "    conditions for combining two numpy arrays ?\n",
    "Ans: It will simply add or multiply element to element at same position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. What is the best way to use a Boolean array to mask another array ?\n",
    "Ans: The best way to use a Boolean array to mask another array is by Using masked_where of numpy package\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. What are three different ways to get the standard deviation of a wide collection of data using both standard Python and\n",
    "its packages? Sort the three of them by how quickly they execute ?\n",
    "Ans: np.std and math package can be used individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What is the dimensionality of a Boolean mask-generated array ?\n",
    "Ans: It will have same dimensionality as input array."
